	class - is a collection of variables & methods. it is a logical entity. it does not occupy memory.
	
	Object - object is a instance of class.it is an physical entity.
	
	method- A method is a block that contains a piece of code to performs specific actions.
	
	Constructor- 1. is a special method that is used to initialize objects.Constructors are almost similar 
		  to methods except for two things - its name is the same as the class name and it has no return type.
		  2. will not return any values
		  3. will be invoked at the time of object creation(we no need to call constructor explicitly)
		  4. will take the parameter (just like method)
		  5. is used only for initialize the values not for writing the logics
		  
		  TWO types of constructor are:
		  1. default constructor
		  2. parameterized constructor

		 Declaration of class:-
		 --------------------------
		 class class_name{
		 variables
		 methods

		 syntax of an object for a class
		 ------------------
		 class_name object_name = new class_name();
		 
		 //to initialize values to variable & to access these methods and variable ---we have to create object
	     // always create object in main method bcoz execution start from main method
		 
		 Syntax of method-
		 --------------------
		 method_name{
		 code...
		 }
		 
		 methods can be of 2 type:-
		 1. some method may not return some values.for this kind of method void before method name.
		 2. some method may return some values. for this kind of method use datatype(eg int String etc) before method n
		 3. method may takes parameter
		 4. method may not takes parameter

	  How many ways we can initilize  the class variable values:-
	  there are 3 diff ways to initialize the values:-
	  1. using object (direct method)
	  2. using constructor
